    "### extract_answers_sequence function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accurate function name\n",
    "- Name is extract_answers_sequence, as provided in the brief\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Organised\n",
    "- Libraries are imported in the beginning\n",
    "- Functions are written in order\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Works as intended\n",
    "- Takes string_file_path (path to quiz answers text file)\n",
    "- Detects lines starting with \"Question\"\n",
    "- Takes the next 4 lines as answer options\n",
    "- Line with [x] is deemed the answer provided\n",
    "- Records the index of the selected answer\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handles skipped questions\n",
    "- If question is not answer (no [x]), then by default the current_answer is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assumes next 4 lines after \"Question\" line are the options\n",
    "- There might be blank lines, but they will be deemed as question options\n",
    "- Improvement suggestion: add code that skips blank lines\n",

    "### write_answers_sequence function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accurate function name\n",
    "- Name is write_answers_sequence, as provided in the brief\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Works as intended\n",
    "- Takes list_answers (integer list) and int_n (respodent ID)\n",
    "- Creates a file path string (new_text_file) and opens it for writing (overwrites if file exists)\n",
    "- Converts each answer from the list into the file with one answer per line\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Proof of debugging\n",
    "- Presence of \"list_answers = extract_answers_sequence(\"data/raw_answers/answers_respondent_1.txt\")\" shows that this member debugs their code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unnecessary comment\n",
    "- Comment \"list_answers = extract_answers_sequence(\"data/raw_answers/answers_respondent_1.txt\")\", while good for debugging, is unneccessary in the final script\n",
    "- Improvement suggestion: remove the comment to make the code look cleaner\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unclear print outcome\n",
    "- Printing \"Answers saved to text file!\" is good to indicate that the function runs as intended, but it is not specific on which text file saved\n",
    "- Imrpovement suggestion: Have it print the actual text file number as well\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Accurate function name\n",
    "- Name is download_answer_files, as provided in the brief\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Organised\n",
    "- Libraries are imported and downloads gdown in the beginning\n",
    "- Functions are written in order\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Works as intended\n",
    "- Takes cloud_url (shared google drive folder URL), path_to_data_folder (where downloaded files are saved), respondent_index (file number) as input\n",
    "- Downloads files from Google Drive folder\n",
    "- Renames files as approriate\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Uses gdown\n",
    "- Uses gdown to downloaded from Google Drive folder\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Give confirmation updates if code is progressing\n",
    "- Prints \"Download complete\" when file is successfully downloaded and \"Download failed\" otherwise, with the specific file number (makes it easier to debug)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assumes gdown is not installed\n",
    "- Checks if gdown is installed first\n",
    "- Improvement suggestion: Try import gdown then import when needed\n",

    "2. Organised\n",
    "- Libraries are imported in the beginning\n",
    "- Functions are written in order\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Works as intended\n",
    "- Takes data_folder_path as input\n",
    "- Ensures the output folder exists and opens for writing\n",
    "- Loops thoguht each answers_list_respondent_n.txt file and appends content to the collated filee\n",
    "- Inserts * as a separator\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Give confirmation updates if code is progressing\n",
    "- Prints \"Download complete\" when file is successfully downloaded and \"Download failed\" otherwise, with the specific file number (makes it easier to debug)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Organise all codes into functions\n",
    "- Some codes are not defined under the function\n",
    "- Improvement Suggest: Put all codes under the function\n",
